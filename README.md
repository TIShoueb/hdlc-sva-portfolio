This repository showcases my verification work for an HDLC controller project. This is basically a class project for DDS2 course,2025, NTNU. 
Focus: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) and test-program based checking.

## What’s inside
- `tb/assertions_hdlc.sv` — concurrent assertions (SVA properties + asserts)
- `tb/testPr_hdlc.sv` — test program / immediate checks and test scenarios
- `docs/` — my report PDF(s)

## Note on reproducibility
The original full RTL/framework is not included in this public extract.
A runnable full version can be shared privately if needed.
